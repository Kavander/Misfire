# Project Misfire
So a little known fact about myself, I LOOVE to name my projects after transformers. There is something about their names that fits a project, mystifying but also related to mecanic and technology.

## Well onto project misfire
Misfire is all about AIMy. The goal will be to develop her skills and give her a nice interface to communicate with the outside world.
